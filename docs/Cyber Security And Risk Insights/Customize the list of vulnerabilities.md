<!-- # Customize the list of vulnerabilities -->
Risk Insights has been greatly improved in version 10.5.0.7. We recommend [updating your installation](http://lansweeper.com/knowledgebase/updating-your-installation/ "updating your installation") if you are running a lower Lansweeper version to ensure an optimized experience.

As cybersecurity gains importance by the day, an organized list of the vulnerabilities affecting your devices becomes a crucial tool in any security officer’s arsenal.

Since more and more vulnerabilities are discovered, the list of Active vulnerabilities tends to grow as well. The Custom views feature allows you to filter unnecessary information from these views and select the data you want to examine further, covering your analytical needs.

With custom views, you can:

- Create a custom view
- Sort by multiple columns
- Create an advanced filter view
- Manage a custom view
- Export a view

This feature is available in Pro and higher plans. It is available for a limited time for all users to try it out. For more information on plans, check out [the pricing page](https://www.lansweeper.com/pricing/).

## Create a custom view

By default, a filter is applied to all vulnerabilities to only show those with a high confidence level. You can remove this filter to show vulnerabilities with a low confidence level as well.

1. Go to **Risk Insights > Active vulnerabilities**, and select **Customize view**. **![Custom vulnerability views 5.png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_050/image_002.jpg)**
2. Under **Fixed columns,**toggle the fixed columns that you want to display **On**or **Off**.
3. Under **Scrollable columns**, hover over a column and select **X** to remove it, or select and hold the column to reorder it.
4. Under **Available columns**, use the search to find the column you want to add, then click to add it to your custom view.
5. Select **Apply**.
6. If you're happy with the view, select **Unsaved View > Save view and configurations**. If you'd like to revert to the previous view, select **Restore the default value**. **![Custom vulnerability views 8.png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_050/image_003.jpg)**
