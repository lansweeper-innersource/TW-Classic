<!-- # View the vulnerabilities affecting assets -->
Risk Insights has been greatly improved in version 10.5.0.7. We recommend [updating your installation](http://lansweeper.com/knowledgebase/updating-your-installation/ "updating your installation") if you are running a lower Lansweeper version to ensure an optimized experience.

To maintain a high level of security, assets need to be free of critical vulnerabilities. Knowing which assets are currently at risk and which are secure is essential.

Risk insights is available in Pro and higher plans. For more information on plans, check out [the pricing page](https://www.lansweeper.com/pricing/).

This article describes two ways to efficiently manage the vulnerabilities affecting your assets.

- Starting from a specific asset
- Starting from a specific vulnerability

You can also identify and address potential security vulnerabilities in your environment through [Lansweeper's Vulnerability API](https://docs.lansweeper.com/docs/api/vulnerabilities "Request vulnerabilities").

## Starting from a specific asset

1. Go to **Risk Insights > Vulnerable assets**.   
   Alternatively, you can start from your inventory as well.
2. Select the asset from the list. A summary of the asset is displayed.
3. Select the **Risk insights** tab. Assets affected by a vulnerability will have the tab marked by a warning icon ![Warning1.png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_056/image_002.jpg).   
   The default view displays the active vulnerabilities with a high confidence score affecting this asset, but ignored vulnerabilities can be shown as well.

To ignore assets and active vulnerabilities, or restore ignored assets and vulnerabilities, take a look at [Ignore assets and vulnerabilities](/docs/ignore-assets-and-vulnerabilities).

## Starting from a specific vulnerability

1. In **Risk Insights**, either go to **Active vulnerabilities** or **Ignored vulnerabilities**.
2. Select the vulnerability from the list. A summary of the vulnerability is displayed.
3. Select the **Assets**tab. All assets affected by this vulnerability are displayed.

Both active and ignored vulnerabilities can be selected to view affected assets.
