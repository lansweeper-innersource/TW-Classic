<!-- # Ignore assets and vulnerabilities -->
Risk Insights has been greatly improved in version 10.5.0.7. We recommend [updating your installation](http://lansweeper.com/knowledgebase/updating-your-installation/ "updating your installation") if you are running a lower Lansweeper version to ensure an optimized experience.

As your list of assets grows, the list of active vulnerabilities often increases in size as well. Not all of these vulnerabilities are always relevant to you and might not even apply to your situation.

Ignoring certain assets or vulnerabilities can remove irrelevant entries from the active list, allowing you to focus on more critical assets or vulnerabilities.

This feature is available in Pro and higher plans. It is available for a limited time for all users to try it out. For more information on plans, check out [the pricing page](https://www.lansweeper.com/pricing/).

## Ignore assets

By default, a filter is applied to all assets to only show those with a high confidence level. You can remove this filter to show entries with a low confidence level as well.

1. Go to **Risk Insights > Vulnerable assets**.
2. Use the checkboxes in front of the assets to select those you wish to exclude from the list.
3. Select **Ignore**.   
   The pop-up informs you of the number of assets that will be ignored, and how many vulnerabilities are affected.
4. Select the reason for excluding the selected assets and select **Apply**.

The selected assets have now been moved from the **Vulnerable assets** view to the **Ignored assets**view.

You may want to exclude specific assets because they are false positives, accepted risks, or irrelevant.

## Restore assets

1. Go to **Risk Insights > Ignored assets**.
2. Use the checkboxes in front of the assets to select those you wish to exclude from the list.
3. Select **Restore**.  
   The pop-up informs you of the number of assets that are affected.
4. Select **Apply**to move the selected assets back to the **Vulnerable assets** menu.

The selected vulnerabilities have now been moved from the **Ignored vulnerabilities** menu back to the **Active vulnerabilities** menu.
