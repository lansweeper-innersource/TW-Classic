![TL;DR-Sweepy-Icon (1).png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_072/image_001.jpg) **This page provides instructions for retrieving and applying a license key for Lansweeper On-premises.**

When you purchase a Lansweeper or helpdesk agent license for Lansweeper On-premises, an email receipt is sent to you with a license key included. You can use the **Click here to download your license** link in your receipt to retrieve your license key. This key must be applied to your installation to unlock Lansweeper's paid features or additional helpdesk agents.

If you purchased a [Lansweeper license from the cloud environment](/docs/buy-a-cloud-license), you can continue to use both Lansweeper On-premises and Lansweeper Sites. However, if you do not plan to use our cloud solution, please contact the Lansweeper Sales team via [our sales form](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/) to move your license.

License keys can only be applied through Lansweeper's **Configuration** menu, as explained in this knowledge base article.

Your license key, as well as all billing-related information, was sent to your billing contact from subscriptions@lansweeper.com upon purchasing. Please make sure to check your spam folder if you can't find the email. If you still can't locate the license key, you can contact our sales team [here](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/).
