<!-- # Leverage HVMND insights -->
![TL;DR-Sweepy-Icon (1).png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_359/image_001.jpg) **This page provides an overview of HVMND insights in Lansweeper Sites, explaining how HVMND insights work, as well as detailing the available insights and their applications for strategic vulnerability management.**

Lansweeper Sites' HVMND elevates the platform into a powerful intelligence engine. HVMND insights offer you access to benchmarking, actionable recommendations, and best practices, all derived from data aggregated across thousands of live IT environments.

While many organizations struggle to extract the full potential of their data, HVMND overcomes this challenge by aggregating and customizing insights from other IT environments.

With HVMND, you can:

- **Benchmark your performance**: Compare your organization’s vulnerability management effectiveness against industry standards, similar organization sizes, and comparable technology stacks.
- **Receive actionable recommendations**: Gain data-driven suggestions for improvement and optimization.
- **Adopt proven best practices**: Learn from successful strategies adopted by others in the community.

## Available HVMND insights

To access HVMND insights, navigate to **Risk insights** in your site and select **Insights**. You can then choose whether you want to benchmark your company’s performance against all companies or companies with a similar tech stack.

The first set of HVMND insights is available in the Risk insights module, with plans to expand these insights across the entire Lansweeper platform.

Currently, you have access to four HVMND insights designed to transform your data into actionable insights for strategic vulnerability management decisions:

| Insight ID | Insight Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HVM-1-CVE | Vulnerability Resolution Rate | The resolution rate shows how effectively you resolve high and critical vulnerabilities, benchmarking your performance against other companies’ resolution rates. |
| HVM-1-Site | Top Unresolved Vulnerabilities by Resolution Rate | The top unresolved high and critical vulnerabilities in an organization that other companies have addressed in the past month. Vulnerabilities are split by their affected product. |
| HVM-5-CVE | Resolution Adoption Rate | The adoption rate represents the percentage of assets using a specific software version relative to the total number of assets utilizing this software that the CVE does not impact. |
| HVM-6-CVE | CVE Criticality Comparison | Each severity level for an organization is compared against other companies, which are ranked and divided into four equal ranges. |

## Enhanced benchmarking with filters

To enhance the benchmarking experience, we've introduced filters that allow you to compare your performance more effectively.   
Data from other companies is ranked and divided into four equal ranges: **worst**, **lower middle**, **upper middle**, and **best**. These categories allow you to understand where your organization stands compared to others.

- **All Companies** filter: provides a broad benchmark by comparing your organization's data to **all Lansweeper companies**.
- **Similar Tech Stack** filter: offers a more precise comparison by benchmarking your performance against companies with **similar technology environments**. This filter considers factors such as the number of assets, asset types, and other relevant parameters, ensuring that your organization is compared to those with a comparable IT setup.
- **Industry**filter: benchmarks your organization’s performance against other organizations operating in the **same industry**. This enables more relevant comparisons by aligning insights with similar business sectors.
- **Country**filter: compares your organization to others located in the **same country**. Country classification is based on the official [United Nations M49 standard](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview/), using country-level data for accurate benchmarking.
- **Segment**filter: provides benchmarking based on your organization’s **market segment**, Enterprise (ENT), Mid-Market (MM), or Small and Medium Business (SMB). Lansweeper assigns a segment based on a combination of factors such as number of employees, asset count, and other key parameters.
