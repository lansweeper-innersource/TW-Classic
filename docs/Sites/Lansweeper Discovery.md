## Benefits

- **Comprehensive discovery**: Gain insights into your network by discovering all IT, OT, and cloud assets, as well as expanded data such as fingerprints (enriched device identifiers), open ports, and Mac users.
- **Enhanced control**: Control when and where your assets are scanned, providing greater flexibility and management over your discovery processes.
- **Future-proofed**: Use lighter, more secure discovery systems that accommodate both cloud and on-premises environments.
- **Usability**: Download Lansweeper Discovery on Windows, Linux, or Mac. Enjoy automatic updates and reduced maintenance time.

## What’s included in Lansweeper Discovery

Lansweeper Discovery comprises three discovery systems, each with unique capabilities and features.

Each discovery system shares similar configuration components, which you can learn more about in [Discovery configuration](/classic/docs/overview-of-discovery-components-and-configuration).



Depending on your requirements and specific needs, you may want to install a specific discovery system, or a combination of multiple discovery systems. The table below provides additional information to help guide your decision.

|  | Network Discovery | IT Agent Discovery | Cloud Discovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Summary** | Discover all IT assets in your network | Collect all details of the computers that have IT Agent Discovery installed and running as a background service or daemon | Identify and catalog all assets within your cloud infrastructure |
| **Asset reach** | Tracks both the machine running Network Discovery and remotely discovers IT assets | Tracks local computers where IT Agent Discovery is running | Tracks cloud environments with authentication set up |
| **Credentials** | Requires credentials to remotely get all asset details | Does not require credentials | Requires authentication to access cloud environments |
| **Network access** | Requires specific ports to be open on the assets to discover.  See [Ports scanned or used by Lansweeper](/classic/docs/ports-scanned-or-used-by-lansweeper) for more information. | Few connectivity requirements.  See [Install IT Agent](/classic/docs/install-it-agent-discovery#Requirements) for more information. | No specific network access required |

## Lansweeper Discovery vs. Lansweeper On-premises scanning

Lansweeper On-premises scanning consists of LsAgent, LsPush and the OT scanne and requires a Lansweeper On-premises installation.   
Lansweeper Discovery is the successor of Lansweeper On-premises and is fully supported by Lansweeper Sites.

Depending on your situation and your needs, you may want to install a specific discovery system, or perhaps a combination of multiple discovery systems.
