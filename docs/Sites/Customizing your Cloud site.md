<!-- # Customizing your Cloud site -->
In Cloud, different sites can be created and managed.

The settings of your currently selected site can be customized in the **Configuration** module. Go to the **Branding** menu to manage your current site.

Only the default Administrator role can customize the site. More information regarding roles can be found in [this knowledge base article](/docs/configure-scopes-permissions-and-roles).

In the **Branding** overview, you can change the site's name and upload a logo. The site logo will be shown in the left pane.   
You can also add a title and disclaimer message for your site. The title and disclaimer message you've written will be shown whenever a user logs into Cloud and selects the site.
