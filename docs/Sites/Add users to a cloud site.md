<!-- # Add users to a cloud site -->
You can invite additional users to your [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/) cloud site, assign them one or more roles and add them to an existing [account group](/docs/configure-scopes-permissions-and-roles).

## Add users to your site

1. Go to your [Lansweeper cloud environment](http://app.lansweeper.com "Lansweeper Cloud environment") and log in using an account that has the Administrator role in your site, for example the account used to create the site.
2. Navigate to the **Configuration** module and select **Account Management**.
3. Select **All accounts** and click **Invite new accounts**.  
   
4. You can invite accounts to your site in one of three ways:  
   - **By email**: invite accounts by manually entering email addresses.
   - **Local installation users**: invite local installation users detected by Lansweeper if their email address has been added.
   - **Active Directory users**: invite Active Directory users found by Lansweeper while scanning your network.  
     
5. Select **Next step**. Assign the selected accounts one or more **Account Groups**, and one or more **Roles**.  
     
   Users who [register an account in cloud](https://app.lansweeper.com/) using their invited email address will now automatically have access to your site.  

   Invited users must verify their account via email within 24 hours. The administrator can send a new verification email if accounts are not verified within 24 hours.
