<!-- # View assets' lifecycle information -->

Lifecycle insights are available in Pro and higher plans. For more information on plans, check out [the pricing page](https://www.lansweeper.com/pricing/).

Lansweeper can retrieve and display the hardware and operating system lifecycle data of your assets. Lifecycle fields include the general availability date of the hardware or OS, End of Life (EOL) date, and End of Support (EOS) date. For more information, check out [Lansweeper for IT Asset Lifecycle Management](https://www.lansweeper.com/use-cases/asset-lifecycle-management/).

## Prerequisites

Ensure Credential-free Device Recognition (CDR) is enabled. CDR is enabled by default, but can be disabled manually.  
For more information on Credential-free Device Recognition, check out [Credential-free Device Recognition](/classic/docs/credential-free-device-recognition-cdr).

## Retrieve lifecycle information

To view a summary of your assets' lifecycle information:

1. In your Lansweeper Site, go to **Dashboard > Lifecycle**.
2. Select  **Run all board reports** to refresh the reports.  
   

## View all lifecycle information

You can access all lifecycle data using one of two methods: you can either view all lifecycle information for an individual asset, or you can get a specific overview of lifecycle information for all assets.

### View lifecycle information for an individual asset

1. In your Lansweeper Site, go to **Inventory**.
2. Select the asset you want to inspect. You can use the search functionality, the preconfigured inventory views, or an advanced filter to find your assets.
3. In the **Risk insights** page, select the **Lifecycle** tab to view lifecycle data.   
   

### View lifecycle information for all assets

To get a comprehensive overview of all lifecycle information:

1. In your Lansweeper Site, go to **Risk insights**.
2. Depending on the data you want to view, select a lifecycle view:

- **Hardware lifecycle**: displays information on hardware assets, such as **Model** and **Manufacturer**.
- **OS lifecycle**: shows operating system lifecycle data, such as **OS** and **Assets**.  
  

Each lifecycle view includes key fields such as **End of Sale**, **End of Support**, and **Milestone date** to help you quickly identify assets that require priority attention.  
The **Milestone date** field displays the most relevant date based on the asset's current stage.
