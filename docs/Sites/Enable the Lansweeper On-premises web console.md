<!-- # Enable the Lansweeper On-premises web console -->

When running only using Lansweeper Sites, you could be requested by the Lansweeper Support or Sales department to enable the Lansweeper On-premises local web console.

## Enable the Lansweeper On-premises web console

1. On the Lansweeper server, run **ResetWebUserRoles.exe**, which can be found in `Program Files (x86)\Lansweeper\Tools`. Select **Enable Built-in Administrator**.  
   
2. Provide a username and password that you will use to access the web console and select **Save**.  
   
3. You can now access the web console using your browser on the Lansweeper server directly. If ports were not changed during the installation, the web console will be accessible at http://localhost:81.  
   When browsing to that page a login screen will be presented where you can fill in the username and password you provided in the previous step. Afterward, select **Built-in Admin**.  
   
4. You will now have access to the Lansweeper On-premises web console.
