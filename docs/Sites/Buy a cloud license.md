<!-- # Buy a cloud license -->

The **License status** menu shows you all information about your Lansweeper license, namely the license type, the current amount of assets, the license’s asset limit, and the expiry date for paid licenses.

Current assets includes all scanned or manually created assets, except for monitors, unless they have associated extended display data.

If you have a trial or freeware site, you can buy a license from this menu. Alternatively, if you already have a license but want to upgrade, you can upgrade your license.

If you already have a cloud-first subscription that you want to transfer to another cloud site, please contact the Lansweeper sales team via [our sales form](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/).
