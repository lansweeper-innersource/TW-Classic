<!-- # Create a Lansweeper Cloud site -->
There are several ways you can create an additional site in your Lansweeper Cloud account. When [logging into Lansweeper Cloud](https://app.lansweeper.com), you can select **Create new site**. This button can be found at the bottom of your screen, below the list of sites you already belong to.



Alternatively, you can create a new site by going to the **Change site** module and selecting **Create a new site**.



Pick your site name carefully, as this name is used as part of your site URL. The display name of a site can be changed after creation, but the internal name used in the URL cannot.  
Note that your site name must be unique and may not contain spaces.
