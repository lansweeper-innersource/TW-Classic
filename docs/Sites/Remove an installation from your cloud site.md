<!-- # Remove an installation from your cloud site -->
If a linked [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/) installation is no longer relevant or useful, has issues with performance or security, or conflicts with your other installations, you can remove that installation by unlinking it from your cloud site.

Once you unlink your installation, your site will no longer receive updates from that installation. If you wish to re-link this installation later, go to **Configuration > Installations > Download installers > Download IT installer**and follow the prompts.

## Remove an installation

1. In your site, go to **Configuration > Installations > All installations**.
2. Select the installation you want to remove.
3. Select **Unlink installation**.
4. In the pop-up, select either **Keep the data** or **Remove all data**.  

   To avoid duplicate conflicts, we recommend selecting **Remove all data**, and **Permanently delete installation and its registry** in the next step.
5. If you've selected **Remove all data**, choose what you would like to do with the installation registry.  

   If you've opted to keep the installation registry accessible, the installation will be shown in the **Archived installations**section of your site. Opting to delete the registry will permanently remove the installation from your site.
6. Finally, enter the name of your site to confirm, then select **Unlink installation**.

Your installation is unlinked. If you've opted to delete your data, this process can take a few minutes to complete.
