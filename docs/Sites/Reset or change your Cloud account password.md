<!-- # Reset or change your Cloud account password -->
Using a strong, unique password for your [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/) account is strongly recommended for security reasons. You can further elevate the security of your account through the use of [SSO (single sign-on)](/docs/set-up-lansweeper-sso) and/or [MFA (multi-factor authentication)](/docs/enable-multi-factor-authentication-mfa).

## Reset your Cloud password

You can easily reset your password using the Cloud login page. Browse to [the login page](https://app.lansweeper.com/) and select **Forgot password?**![cloud-reset-password.png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_370/image_002.jpg)

You will be asked to submit the email address of your Cloud account. An email is now sent to your email address, with a link to change your password. Click the link in the email and submit your new, preferred password. Make sure your password meets the Cloud password requirements. After submission, you can log into Cloud with your email address and new password.
