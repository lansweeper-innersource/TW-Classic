<!-- # Cloud linking requirements -->
Every 12 hours, prerequisite checks are performed in the background of your system to ensure your installation can be linked to a cloud site.

If the prerequisites have passed, you can [link your installation to a cloud site](/docs/link-lansweeper-on-prem-with-lansweeper-sites "Link with Cloud").

If a prerequisite check fails, you will receive a notification in your alerts tab about the issue. Select **Learn how to fix it** to be redirected to the prerequisite page.

To learn how to resolve a failed check, follow the instructions in the relevant article below:
