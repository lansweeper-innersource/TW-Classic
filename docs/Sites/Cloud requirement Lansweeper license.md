<!-- # Cloud requirement: Lansweeper license -->
When you start setting up a link with your [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/) cloud site, some prerequisite checks are performed to ensure your installation is ready to link. When you select **Link with Cloud site** in your local web console, a pop-up is presented with a pass/fail indication for a number of prerequisite checks. One of the checks is whether your Lansweeper license is eligible for linking with Cloud.

## Why is my Lansweeper license checked?

Not all Lansweeper licenses are eligible for linking with Cloud. Your license's eligibility to link with a Cloud site is evaluated based on a number of factors, including license type. Certain legacy licenses are not eligible for instance.

## What do I do if the license check fails?

Make sure you've [applied your most recently received Lansweeper license](/docs/apply-your-lansweeper-license). Try syncing with Cloud again if you've applied a different license. If the issue persists or you're already using the correct license, please contact the Sales team to discuss your licensing situation.
