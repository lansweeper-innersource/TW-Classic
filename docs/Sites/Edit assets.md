<!-- # Edit assets -->
Lansweeper automatically discovers your assets' data through scans. You can also edit your asset to correct existing scanned data, or add financial information, asset location, maintenance records, relations, and more!

OT assets can also be edited in Lansweeper Sites. For more information, see [Manage OT assets from Lansweeper Sites](/classic/docs/manage-ot-assets-in-lansweeper-sites).

To update your assets' information:

- Edit individual assets
- Bulk edit assets
- Create custom fields

## Edit individual assets

1. In **Inventory**, find the asset you want to edit. To find your assets, you can:
   - Use the search bar.
   - Create an [advanced filter or custom view](/classic/docs/view-assets  "View assets").
   - Search through the pre-configured views.
2. Select the name of the asset that you want to edit.
3. You’re redirected to the asset page. Select **Edit asset**.
4. Edit the asset’s information in the various fields.  

   Although you can change the **Asset type** for a Windows asset to another type, rescanning the asset will automatically revert its asset type back to Windows.
5. Select **Save and Exit**.

You can not modify fields with [normalized data](/classic/docs/software-data-normalization "Normalize your data") to ensure the data within the inventory remains consistent.

## Bulk edit assets

1. Select the range of assets that you would like to edit. You can:
   - Select individual assets: Individually select the checkbox of the assets that you’d like to edit.
   - Select a range of assets: Select the checkbox of the asset you’d like to edit, then hold **Shift** and select another asset from the list to select the range of assets between them.
   - Select all assets: Select the arrow next to the checkbox, then click **Select all results.**
2. Click **Bulk Edit**. 
3. Select the field you want to bulk edit from the dropdown menu.
4. Enter a value to bulk edit from the dropdown menu. These values will be different depending on the field you selected.  

   Although you can change the **Asset type** for Windows assets to another type, rescanning the assets will automatically revert their asset type back to Windows.
5. Click **Save and Apply.** A message appears to confirm the system is processing your bulk edits. You can queue up to five bulk edits at a time.

## Create custom fields

Track specific information that is relevant to your environment by adding custom fields to the asset's information page. Once you add a custom field, every asset will have that same custom field with the unique value that you set individually.

To create custom fields:

1. In **Inventory**, select **Manage custom fields**.
2. Select **Add new custom field**.
3. Enter a field name and field type.
4. Select **Save Changes**.

To add a value to your custom field, individually or bulk edit your assets.

You can also add your custom field to a [custom view](/classic/docs/view-assets#view "View assets") or advanced filter.
