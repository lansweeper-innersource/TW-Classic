<!-- # Manage your Cloud account profile settings -->
Your profile settings are an essential part of your Lansweeper Cloud experience, allowing you to personalize and manage your account information.

In Lansweeper Cloud, you'll automatically be logged out under two conditions:

- After 3 days of user inactivity.
- After 7 days, regardless of user activity.

## Change your account's profile settings

In your Lansweeper Cloud site, go to **Settings** **> Profile**.  


In this menu, you can:

- Edit or remove your first name.
- Edit or remove your last name.
- Edit or remove your phone number.
- Edit or remove your profile picture.



The email address of an account is the only field you cannot edit or remove.

## View profile info of other users

If you are the owner or an administrator of a site, you can view the profile info of other users in the **Configuration > Account management > All accounts** menu.

You can select a specific user to see their profile info.
