<!-- # Software data normalization -->
In IT, OT, and IoT asset management, consistent and accurate data is essential for effective monitoring and reporting. Lansweeper Sites’s [normalization feature](https://www.lansweeper.com/pro-tips/lansweeper-data-normalization/) addresses any potential inconsistencies by standardizing software data across the platform. This ensures consistent information, regardless of the source, enhancing the value of your asset inventory.

Using machine learning, Lansweeper Sites normalizes software names, publishers and version numbers. For instance, where a Google software product may have its publisher listed as "Google LLC" or the older "Google Inc" in Add/Remove Programs, Lansweeper Sites will normalize all of these publisher names to "Google".

## View normalized software

Normalized software can be found in fields throughout Lansweeper Sites.

### Software menu and asset pages

Your list of scanned software found in the **Software**module displays a normalized list of software.   
You can also view normalized software data in the **Installed software** view found in individual asset pages.

### Risk insights

Normalized software data is used in the **Risk insights**module to assess potential vulnerabilities, helping you identify and mitigate risks more effectively.

### Reports and API

All reports in the **Reports**module display a normalized list of software.  
Similarly, API data also include normalized software information.

We're currently in the process of refactoring the webhook system to enhance its functionality. At this time, webhooks do not include normalized software data, but they will continue to provide scanned data.
