<!-- # Delete cloud sites and accounts -->
Deleting sites and accounts in the cloud environment is a critical aspect of managing data security and ensuring privacy. Whether the sites or accounts are unused or unnecessary, the process is essential to safeguarding sensitive information and reducing the risk of data breaches. 

If you want to learn more about how Lansweeper protects your information, check out our [Trust Center](https://www.lansweeper.com/trust/).

You can modify your site and accounts in a variety of ways. For example, you can:

- Delete a cloud site
- Disable a user's access
- Delete a user's account
- Delete your own account

## Delete a cloud site

Deleting a cloud site will irreversibly delete the site itself and its installation data from Lansweeper. Lansweeper Cloud [custom views](/docs/view-assets#view "View assets"), [custom reports](/docs/introduction-to-the-report-builder), and [custom fields](/docs/edit-assets#customfield) will also be lost and not recoverable.

If your Lansweeper Cloud site is linked to a paid license, it can only be manually deleted with help from the Lansweeper Sales team. Contact the Lansweeper Sales team via [our sales form](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/) to first move your subscription, before continuing with the steps below.

1. Navigate to the cloud site you want to delete, and log in using an account that has the **Edit site settings** permission.
2. Go to **Configuration > Site settings**.
3. Select **Delete this site**.

4. Enter the name of your site then select **Delete this site** to confirm.

5. The process of deleting the site may take a while to complete. The exact duration depends on the size of your site and the amount of data stored within.  

   Deleting a site in cloud has no impact on your local Lansweeper installation or data. All data that is stored in your on-premises installation is preserved.

## Modify accounts

To revoke a user's access to your cloud site:

- Disable a user's access
- Delete a user's account

You can also permanently Delete your own account.

### Disable a user's access

1. Go to **Configuration > Account Management > All accounts**.
2. Select the user you wish to disable. The user's account will open in edit mode.
3. Set **Site access** to **OFF** using the toggle button. Once the access is disabled, the user will no longer be able to access the site.

### Delete a user's account

1. Go to **Configuration > Account Management > All accounts**.

3. Select **Delete account ![Delete cloud site and accounts 3.png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_333/image_005.jpg)**, and select **Yes** in the pop-up.
