<!-- # Link your installations with Lansweeper Sites -->

You can link various installations to your site to access Lansweeper’s full capabilities.

Once you’ve [created a new Lansweeper Site](/docs/create-a-lansweeper-cloud-site), the following installation scenarios can occur:

- Link a new sites-only installation
- Link an existing on-premise installation
- Link a new on-premise installation
- Link an OT installation

## Link a new sites-only installation

You must link an installation to the site to start scanning your assets.

To link a sites-only installation:

1. In your newly created site, go to **Configuration > Installations > Download installers/packages**.
2. Select **Download Lansweeper On-premises IT**.
3. Open the downloaded file.
4. Navigate through the Lansweeper setup installer with the recommended settings.
5. When prompted for the linking code, go back to your site.
6. In your site, go to **Configuration > Installations > Link an installation**.
7. Select **Create new** **code**, select an expiration period and select **Apply**.
8. Select **Copy code**, and paste it into the installer. Continue with the installation.

Once the installation is complete, you can view the installation on **Configuration > Installations > All installations**.

## Link an existing on-premise installation

If you have an existing on-premise installation, you can link the installation to a site to access the benefits of both products.

To link an existing installation:

1. Ensure you’ve [updated to the latest on-premise version](/docs/update-your-lansweeper-sites-scan-server).
2. In your site, go to **Configuration > Installations > Link an installation**.
3. Select **Create new** **code**, select an expiration period and select **Apply**.
4. Select **Copy code**.
5. Navigate to your on-premise web console. Select **Link with cloud site**.
6. Select **I have a linking code**. If you have multiple scan servers, you will be asked which one should be responsible for syncing with Lansweeper Sites. This server will be the sync server.
7. Paste the linking code and select **Submit**.
