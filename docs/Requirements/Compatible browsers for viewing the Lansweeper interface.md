<!-- # Compatible browsers for viewing the Lansweeper interface -->

[Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/ "Lansweeper") has a web interface which can be viewed in a web browser locally from the Lansweeper server, or remotely from other machines in your network. The web console displays scanned and custom data, reports and settings in a comprehensible way and allows you to make changes to them.

Below is a list of officially supported browsers for interface viewing. Browsers not listed below may work as well, especially if they're Chromium-based. However, unsupported browsers have not been tested for possible layout issues and may not be able to run asset or user actions.

Other Lansweeper installation requirements like architecture, operating system, database server, disk space and installed software are discussed in [this dedicated requirements article](/docs/lansweeper-installation-requirements).

A local Lansweeper installation can also be [linked with Lansweeper Sites](/docs/introduction-to-lansweeper-sites). If an installation is linked, its data can be viewed in the site as well. The list of supported web browsers differs for Lansweeper Sites compared to Lansweeper On-premises.
