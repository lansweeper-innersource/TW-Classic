<!-- # Configure Microsoft Edge to run actions -->
To run asset and user actions from [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/), Microsoft Edge needs to be configured.

To learn more about creating actions, see [Custom Actions](https://www.lansweeper.com/feature/custom-actions/).

Microsoft Edge is a Chromium-based web browser. Lansweeper has a Chromium extension that can be installed in browsers like Edge to allow for the execution of asset and user actions. As Lansweeper's Chromium extension is offered through the Chrome Web Store, you must first configure Edge to allow extensions from this store.

You must use version 79 or higher of Microsoft Edge, as these are Chromium-based versions. Older, non-Chromium-based versions of Edge are not supported for Lansweeper use.   
Microsoft Edge must also be used on a Windows computer to run asset and user actions.

## Install the Lansweeper Chromium extension

1. Type "edge://extensions" in Edge's address bar, and press **Enter**.
2. Toggle the **Allow extensions from other stores** switch. In the pop-up, select **Allow**.  
   
3. Download and run [the Lansweeper Chromium extension installer](https://www.lansweeper.com/files/LansweeperExtension_6.0.exe) and select **Next**. The executable adds a Lansweeper folder with the Chromium extension components to your computer.   
   
4. Restart Edge and browse to [this Chrome Web Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lansweeper-shell-execute/nnpeignlpkmbhjegcbfacbgcnhhjlghp).
5. Select **Get** to install the Lansweeper extension.   
   
6. Select **Add extension** in the confirmation pop-up.
7. Make sure the extension is enabled.   
   Type "edge://extensions" in Edge's address bar, select Enter and enable the extension, if it's not already enabled.
