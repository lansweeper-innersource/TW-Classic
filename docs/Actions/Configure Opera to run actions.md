<!-- # Configure Opera to run actions -->
To run asset and user actions from [Lansweeper](https://www.lansweeper.com/), Opera needs to be configured correctly.

Opera is a Chromium-based web browser. Lansweeper has a Chromium extension that can be installed in browsers like Opera to allow for the execution of asset and user actions. However, you'll first need to configure Opera to allow for the installation of Chromium extensions.

The commands of asset and user actions are Windows-based, so you must be using Opera on a Windows computer to run actions.

1. Download and run [this Lansweeper Chromium extension installer](https://www.lansweeper.com/files/LansweeperExtension_6.0.exe) and select **Next**. The executable adds a Lansweeper folder with the Chromium extension components to your computer. ![configuring-google-chrome-to-run-actions-1.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_004/image_001.jpg)
2. Restart Opera and browse to [this Chrome Web Store link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lansweeper-shell-execute/nnpeignlpkmbhjegcbfacbgcnhhjlghp).
3. Select **Add to Opera**to install the Lansweeper extension.
