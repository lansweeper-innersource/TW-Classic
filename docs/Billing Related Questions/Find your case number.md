<!-- # Find your case number -->
When you contact the Lansweeper customer service through one of our available channels, you may be asked to provide your case number and/or your case reference number. You can find these numbers in the title of the automated email reply you received after sending a support request to one of our email addresses.

[The Lansweeper knowledge base](https://www.lansweeper.com/kb/) contains a wealth of information and hundreds of articles on the Lansweeper software. You can use the available search bar to find any information you need. If you have a question or issue related to the Lansweeper software, we recommend searching through the knowledge base first, as there is a good chance you'll find the answer to your question there.
