<!-- # Renew your Lansweeper subscription -->
Existing Lansweeper subscriptions cannot be renewed through our online store or through our reseller portal.

In this article, we'll guide you through the straightforward steps to renew your subscription with ease.

If you require further information regarding your renewal, or if you want to update your contact information, please contact the Lansweeper sales team via [our sales form](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/) or contact your Lansweeper sales representative directly.

## Renewing through Lansweeper

If you did not cancel recurring billing, the billing contact (specified during your initial purchase) will receive an email from the Lansweeper sales representative 60 to 90 days prior to your subscription's expiration date.

Should you wish to make changes to your subscription, or if you’d like to cancel instead, please contact the Lansweeper sales team via [our sales form](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/) or contact your Lansweeper sales representative directly more than 30 days ahead of your renewal.

Our system currently does not allow you to renew early, as this would cause overlap between your old and new license key. You can however approve of the renewal in advance. Contact the Lansweeper sales team via our sales form to set up an early renewal.

When your renewal is completed a confirmation email is sent to the billing contact. Depending on the purchased license:

- Lansweeper Classic: The confirmation email contains both your receipt and instructions on how to obtain your newly generated license key. The license period starts running from the moment your new key is generated.
- Lansweeper Cloud: The confirmation email contains your receipt. Your Cloud subscription will automatically be renewed.

Your new contract will start once an invoice has been generated. This ensures that you won't be billed for multiple contracts simultaneously. A purchase order or a signed DocuSign document needs to be provided to ensure that an invoice can be generated.

## Renewing through Cleverbridge

If you did not cancel recurring billing, the billing contact (specified during your initial purchase) will receive an automated email 60 days prior to your subscription's expiration date. This automated email includes your renewal cost and renewal instructions.

If you did previously cancel recurring billing for your subscription, you will not receive the automated renewal email. If you would still like to renew your subscription after you canceled recurring billing, please contact the Lansweeper sales team via [our sales form](https://www.lansweeper.com/contact-sales/). By contacting Lansweeper directly, you’ll receive the most up to date information regarding our product from your representative.
