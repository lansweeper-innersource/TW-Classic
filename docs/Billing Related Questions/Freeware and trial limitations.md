<!-- # Freeware and trial limitations -->
If you're thinking of starting your Lansweeper journey but find yourself uncertain about which option best suits your needs, a Lansweeper trial might provide help. Should the trial period still not be enough to decide on a Lansweeper solution, you don't have to worry as your trial installation will revert to freeware mode.

In what follows, we'll take a look at possible limitations for both of these scenarios. 

Both trial and freeware users are able to set up a link with [Lansweeper Sites](https://www.lansweeper.com/). For more information on Lansweeper Sites, take a look at [Introduction to Lansweeper Sites](/classic/docs/introduction-to-lansweeper-sites).

## Trial limitations

Lansweeper currently offers two trial experiences: the [Lansweeper](/classic/docs/install-the-lansweeper-trial) trial, and the [Lansweeper On-prem](/classic/docs/trialling-lansweeper#onprem) trial. Regardless of which trial you've chosen, the trial includes technical support and access to all features available in the Lansweeper product. You can submit a business or a non-business email address to start your trial, and it is not limited in the number of assets.

If you want to learn more about the Lansweeper trials, see [Trialling Lansweeper](/classic/docs/trialling-lansweeper).

## Freeware limitations

When your trial or purchased Lansweeper license expires, Lansweeper reverts to freeware mode. No data or settings are deleted, but several features become unavailable.

The freeware version of Lansweeper has the following limitations:

- Maximum of 100 assets
  - The 100 assets with the most recent scan attempts prior to entering freeware mode will continue to receive updated scan data.
  - All other assets will remain available in your inventory and reports, but they will no longer be updated until your license is renewed.
  - If you had fewer than 100 assets when your license expired, Lansweeper will continue scanning new assets until the asset limit is reached.
- No access to technical support
- No access to hotfixes
