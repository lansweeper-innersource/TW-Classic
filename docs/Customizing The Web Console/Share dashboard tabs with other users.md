<!-- # Share dashboard tabs with other users -->
By default, everyone in your network has access to the Lansweeper web console and can log in with either the **Built-in Admin** button or a Windows username and password. The **Built-in Admin** button gives full access to Lansweeper's asset management and other features, whereas logging in with a Windows user by default only gives access to the helpdesk. You can of course reconfigure access and specify who has rights to what.

Users with asset management rights each have their own dashboard with asset data, whose contents they can configure. Dashboard tabs containing asset data can be shared as global tabs, so all users with asset management rights can see them.

To share a dashboard tab with all users who have asset management rights:

1. Make sure your user role includes the **Share Dashboard Tabs** permission. If it doesn't, you won't be able to share dashboard tabs. More information on configuring website access and specifying who has what permissions can be found in [this knowledge base article](/docs/restrict-access-to-the-web-console).
2. Select the tab you want to share and select the pencil shaped edit button in the tab header.![sharing-dashboard-tabs-with-other-users-1.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_046/image_002.jpg)
3. Tick the checkbox **Shared Tab (Visible for all users)** and select **Ok**. The tab is now visible to all users with asset management rights.
