<!-- # OT supported protocols -->
Lansweeper OT allows you to scan various vendors' devices with supported protocols.

Various protocols are [supported by default](#supported "Supported protocols"), but you can also [add protocol configurations](#protocolconfig "Add protocol configurations") as necessary.

For an overview of Lansweeper OT, see [Lansweeper for OT Asset Management](https://www.lansweeper.com/use-cases/ot-asset-management/).

## Supported protocols

The table below shows a list of supported protocols, as well as associated vendors and their devices.

Some vendors may be supported that are not listed, so long as they use a supported protocol.

You can also view a list of supported protocols in the **Hub > Protocols**.

OPC UA is supported by multiple vendors.
