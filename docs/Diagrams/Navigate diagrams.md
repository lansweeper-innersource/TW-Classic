<!-- # Navigate diagrams -->
Once you’ve [generated a diagram](/classic/docs/generate-diagrams), you can navigate the diagrams in various ways. Go to **Diagrams** and select your desired diagram from the available views. From there, you can either:

- Left-click and hold your mouse cursor to drag your diagram in the direction of your choice to visualize and explore its content.  
  
- Use the scrollbars to navigate horizontally or vertically on the diagram.
- Zoom in or out of the diagram using the scrollbar or **Ctrl+wheel** on your mouse.

Click on an asset's name to be redirected to its Summary page in the Inventory.

On each asset you can learn more about your assets by selecting the following options:

- **Information**: Get details about the asset without having to leave the diagram.
- **Issues**: See the details of the problems encountered on the asset. This is only displayed if errors exist.
- **Running Status**: Displays the running status of the virtual asset.  

  This action is currently only supported for virtual assets of the following types: Hyper-V, Citrix, and VMware.

From an asset, you can also add a relation. For more information about adding asset relations, see [Discover asset relations using diagrams](/classic/docs/discover-asset-relations-with-diagrams).

To control how assets are displayed, see [Personalize diagrams](/classic/docs/personalize-diagrams).
