<!-- # Find assets with integrated search on diagrams -->
The integrated search allows you to find all assets that are within your diagram’s [scope](/docs/generate-diagrams#scope), including assets displayed on the diagram itself, [orphan assets](/docs/discover-asset-relations-with-diagrams#orphan), or assets that have been [filtered](/docs/filter-assets-on-diagrams) to not show on the diagram. This ensures that if your asset is in your diagram's scope, you can easily find it.

For more information about Diagrams and its features, see [Diagrams](https://www.lansweeper.com/feature/diagrams/).

To find a specific asset:

1. In your Lansweeper Site, go to **Diagrams** and select the diagram you desire.
2. Select **Find an asset** .
3. From here, you can search for your asset by the following attributes:
   - Asset name
   - IP Address
   - MAC address
   - Asset type

The search results are displayed as follows:

- Displayed assets: If you select an asset displayed on your diagram, you will be repositioned to locate the asset.
- Orphan assets: If you select an orphan asset, you will be repositioned on the Orphans list to locate the asset. For more information on orphans, see [Handle orphans](/docs/discover-asset-relations-with-diagrams#Orphans).
- Assets affected by your filters: These assets can not be selected in a search result, as they are not displayed on your diagram or Orphan list.

If you perform a search for an asset and can not find it, ensure you’re looking at the correct diagram with the scope you desire.
