<!-- # Diagrams -->
Discover and understand the state of your Inventory through Lansweeper Sites' diagramming and mapping capabilities. Diagrams discover the relations between your assets with dynamically generated layouts, reinforcing your inventory management and allowing dependency mapping.

## **Why should I use Diagrams?**

IT environments are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity makes it challenging to understand the scope and configuration of an organization's IT system. Networks consist of a variety of interconnected systems, applications, and hardware. Business-critical technologies often depend on each other, and a single change can impact the entire infrastructure. A solid asset inventory is a good start, but you need more than a list of your IT assets to control your IT estate fully.

Network mapping goes beyond identifying IT assets and towards understanding their location, connections, and interactions. It provides a complete picture of the IT environment, increasing efficiency, analytics, and effective communication within IT teams. Network mapping tools show how IT assets in your network are connected and interact with each other, giving clear insights into the impact of one link on the entire system. This helps to identify and troubleshoot problems, streamline IT operations, and allocate resources more effectively.

Understanding the relationships between your IT assets is crucial, as it allows you to identify underutilized or orphan assets, which can optimize resource allocation, help with business continuity planning as well as incident, change, and security management, and aid in cost efficiency and strategic planning.

## **How do Diagrams work?**

Diagrams are essentially a visual representation of your Inventory synced with a Lansweeper Site. They are automatically generated based on how you’ve configured your Lansweeper installations and IP Locations in your Lansweeper Site's Inventory. The information is then organized based on your network topologies and virtual environments.

For Diagrams to work correctly, your installations must be synced with your Lansweeper Site, and your Inventory must be configured correctly, including IP Locations.

We recommend configuring your SNMP credentials and exposing network interface uplinks to help detect the relations between assets. For more information, see [Discover asset relations with diagrams](/docs/discover-asset-relations-with-diagrams "Discover asset relations with diagrams") .
