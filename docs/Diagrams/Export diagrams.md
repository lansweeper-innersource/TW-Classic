<!-- # Export diagrams -->
In your Lansweeper site (in the cloud), export your diagrams to create a snapshot of your diagram which you can use for various documentation purposes, such as compliance, reports, presentations, and more.

For more information about Diagrams and its features, see [Diagrams](https://www.lansweeper.com/feature/diagrams/).

To export diagrams:

1. In your Lansweeper Site, go to **Diagrams** and select the diagram you want to export from the list.
2. Ensure the diagram is [personalized](/docs/personalize-diagrams) and [filtered](/docs/filter-assets-on-diagrams) how you desire.
3. Select **Export** ![export-icon.png](/docs/.document360/assets/article_065/image_002.jpg).

4. Decide to export your diagram into the following formats:
   - **JPG**: JPG offers a lossy compressed graphic image file, ideal for small diagrams and integration into your documents and reports.
   - **PNG**: PNG is a raster image file type that can handle transparent backgrounds. It is an alternative to JPG, also ideal for embedding in your documents and reports.
   - **SVG**: As a vector file, SVG can be scaled without losing its resolution, and its content can be searched, indexed, and scripted. Ideal for more extensive diagrams and the highest-quality prints.

SVG files are actionable files. By using this file format, the titles of your assets remain clickable and redirect you to your Inventory. These files can also [be imported into Microsoft Visio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/import-or-insert-graphics-into-visio-drawings-f05e556d-a158-4e16-9bd8-5d45071c9b8c).

The file is downloaded to your computer and can be shared accordingly.
