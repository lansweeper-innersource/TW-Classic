<!-- # Create asset relation types -->
Your Lansweeper Classic installation allows you to [link assets to other assets or users](/classic/docs/link-assets-to-other-assets-or-users) and to define the asset/user relationship. You can specify that asset A is owned by user A for instance and that asset B is backed up to asset C. There are several built-in relation types, but you can create your own relation types as well.

## Create your own asset relation type

1. Go to the **Configuration > Relational Mapping**section of the web console.
2. Select **Add Relation Type**.
3. Enter a name and reverse name.
4. Optionally, you can link your own icons to the relation type by placing them in the `Program Files (x86)\Lansweeper\Website\images` folder, found on the computer hosting your Lansweeper web console. Icons should be in the .jpeg, .jpg or .png format and must be stored in two resolutions: 10x10 pixels and 16x16 pixels.
5. Select **Ok**. The relation type is now included in any relation type dropdowns within the web console.
