<!-- # Place assets on a map -->
Your Lansweeper installation allows you to upload blueprints or maps of your offices and place assets on them so your employees can easily locate equipment.

When an asset is placed on a map, you can click on its asset name to view its Lansweeper webpage and scanned data.

For complex environments you can nest locations, placing locations within locations. You could create a location map for each office for instance and then add the individual offices to a larger office building map.

1. Browse to the **Assets > New Location**section of the web console.![menu-assets-new-location.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_137/image_001.jpg)
2. Enter a location name and a description into the available input boxes.
3. To add your own blueprint/map to the asset location, select **Change image**. Select **Browse...** or **Choose File** in the pop-up window to launch Windows Explorer, select your file and select **Open**. Supported file formats are: .bmp, .gif, .jpeg, .jpg and .png. When you've selected your map, select **Ok**.

4. To place assets on the map of your choice, select **Add assets to location**. In the resulting pop-up window, tick the checkboxes in front of the assets you would like to add and select **Ok**.![placing-assets-on-a-map-2.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_137/image_003.jpg)
   - You can search through one or more columns to easily find specific assets. In the example above, we filtered the Domain column to only list assets within the "lansweeper" domain.
   - You could also tick the top checkbox to select all assets in the current search results.
5. Click and hold the name of an asset to drag the asset to a new position. To undo all of your position changes, select **Set To Default Position**. You can also show/hide asset names by selecting **Toggle Asset Names**.![placing-assets-on-a-map-3.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_137/image_004.jpg)
6. When you're happy with your location map, select **Save location**. You can make additional changes afterwards by selecting **Edit location** on the location page.
7. Locations are automatically added to the **Location** section of the asset type overview, which you can see when hovering over the **Assets** section. You can quickly access them from there.![placing-assets-on-a-map-4.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_137/image_005.jpg)  

   Location maps are technically assets as well. When placing a Windows computer on a location map for instance, you are effectively creating an asset relation between the Windows computer asset and the location map asset. When creating reports on assets and their location maps, you need to report on this asset relationship. There are two built-in sample reports in the **Reports** tab of the web console that list location map data, called Assets: Assets and location maps they're on and Assets: Location maps and assets on them.
