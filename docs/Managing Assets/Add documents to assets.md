<!-- # Add documents to assets -->
To link purchase or other documents to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Browse to the asset's detailed webpage and select **Add document** in the **Docs** tab of the page.
2. Select **Browse...** or **Choose File** in the pop-up window to launch Windows Explorer, select your file and select **Open**. The following file formats are allowed: .7z, .bin, .cab, .csb, .csv, .doc, .docx, .dotx, .gif, .ini, .iso, .jpeg, .jpg, .log, .msg, .nfo, .odp, .ods, .odt, .ost, .pcc, .pdf, .png, .potx, .ppt, .pptx, .pst, .rar, .rtf, .tar, .tar.gz, .txt, .vsd, .vsdx, .xls, .xlsx, .xltx, .xml and .zip.
3. Enter a name for the document into the Display Name field of the pop-up window and select **Ok**.  

   Uploaded asset docs are stored in the `Program Files (x86)\Lansweeper\Website\DOCS` folder, found on the computer hosting your web console.

   You can prevent users from uploading documents. More info on restricting web console access can be found in [this knowledge base article](/docs/restrict-access-to-the-web-console).
4. You can open a document you've uploaded by clicking its display name in the **Docs** tab of the asset's detailed webpage. The **Docs** tab header allows you to quickly identify machines with attached documents, without actually opening the Docs tab.
