<!-- # Hide the Helpdesk menu -->
From version 6.0 onward, the Lansweeper Classic software includes [a fully functional helpdesk](https://www.lansweeper.com/kb-category/configuring-and-using-the-help-desk/). At its core, the helpdesk is a resource for sharing knowledge with people inside or outside of your company. It boasts a robust ticketing system that allows people to ask each other questions and request support. It also includes a knowledge base to share articles on a variety of topics, a company news widget and a calendar to keep track of meetings, vacation days and more.

You'll notice the **Helpdesk** menu in the Lansweeper Classic web console where you can view and respond to incoming tickets. If your company has no immediate need for a helpdesk, it is possible to disable section.

3. Refresh your web browser. The **Helpdesk** menu has now been removed from view, as you can see in the screenshot below. Helpdesk widgets have also been removed from the **Add Widgets** dashboard menu. If you decide you want to use the helpdesk at a later time, you can always re-enable helpdesk functionality by unchecking the option in the previous step. The hidden menu and dashboard options will become available again.
