<!-- # Choose the helpdesk language -->
From version 6.0 onward, the Lansweeper software includes a fully functional helpdesk. The helpdesk portion of Lansweeper can be displayed in each user's preferred language. English, Dutch, French and German are built-in language options, but you can optionally add your own translations to the helpdesk as well. To configure which languages users can select and to optionally add your own translations, do the following:

1. Browse to the **Configuration > Translations**section of the web console.

2. To enable a language for selection in the helpdesk, select it from the **Languages** dropdown and tick the **Enabled** checkbox. English, Dutch, French and German are built-in translations and enabled by default. You can enable additional languages however and submit your own translations.
3. Choose a default language from the **Default Language** dropdown. The helpdesk will be displayed in this language for users that don't select a preferred language.

4. If you enabled a language that's not built-in, submit your own translations for the web console buttons and menus in the **Translation** column. Any translations you submit are added to the .cfg file of the corresponding language in the helpdesk folder at `Program Files (x86)\Lansweeper\Website\lang` on your Lansweeper server. You can share your .cfg translation files with other Lansweeper users on our forum or import them into another Lansweeper installation.

5. If you enabled a language that's not built-in, optionally submit your own translations for customizable text in the helpdesk. Many customizable helpdesk options have blue **A** buttons that allow you to submit translations. In the resulting popups, select the language you want to translate to and then submit your translations. You can submit translations for items in the news widget for instance, in the **Configuration > News Page** section of the web console.

6. When users log into the helpdesk for the first time, they'll be asked to choose their preferred language from the languages you enabled. They can also change their preferred language by clicking the gear icon next to their username. All buttons, menus and customizable text will be displayed in the users' preferred language.
