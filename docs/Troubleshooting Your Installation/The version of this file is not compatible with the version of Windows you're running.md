<!-- # The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running -->
When you've downloaded the Lansweeper executable and run it to perform a Lansweeper installation, you may encounter the error seen below.

The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.

This error seems to imply that the Lansweeper software is incompatible, i.e. that it is a 64-bit program being run on a 32-bit machine. This error message is completely misleading however and does not indicate what the actual cause of the issue is. The reason for the error is that the Lansweeper executable was not fully downloaded and is -incomplete. The corrupt download may be caused by a disruption in internet connectivity or a firewall or anti-virus software erroneously interrupting the download.

Lansweeper can be installed on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.

To resolve the error above, follow these steps:

1. Make sure your internet connection is stable and that your firewalls and anti-virus software are not blocking access to the Lansweeper website.   
   If it turns out your anti-virus software was blocking access, please let our support team know at [support@lansweeper.com](mailto:support@lansweeper.com?subject=False%20positive%20when%20downloading%20LansweeperSetup.exe) so we can report the false positive to the vendor.
2. Re-download **LansweeperSetup.exe** from [our download page](https://www.lansweeper.com/install-lansweeper/).
3. Right-click **LansweeperSetup.exe** and select **Properties**.

4. Make sure the file size listed in the **Details** tab matches the one mentioned on our download page. If the executable is much smaller than what is listed on our download page, it is incomplete and should be re-downloaded.
