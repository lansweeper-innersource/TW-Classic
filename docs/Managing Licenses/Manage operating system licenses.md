<!-- # Manage operating system licenses -->
Your Lansweeper Classic installation allows you to track any operating system licenses you've purchased for your Windows computers.

You can create a license item that consists of just one specific OS or group several operating systems together under one license item. Additional information can then be submitted, such as number of licenses purchased, price per license and order details. Purchase and other documents can be uploaded and linked to license items as well.

When you've configured operating system license compliance, Lansweeper will compare the number of licenses you've indicated were purchased against the number of OS installations in your network. A calculation is made of the number of missing licenses as well as the cost of filling in these licenses.

To create a license item:

1. Browse to the **Software > Operating Systems > Edit Purchased Licenses**section of the web console.  
   ![menu-software-operating-systems-edit-purchased-licenses.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_140/image_001.jpg)
2. Select **Add new License**.
3. Select an operating system you want to track from the list of scanned operating systems in the pop-up window. Search to easily find specific operating systems.   
   Alternatively, select **Add Operating system to list** to submit an OS that hasn't been scanned yet. Select **Add** afterwards.

7. In the **Docs** tab, select **Add Document** to upload any related purchase or other documents. Select **Choose File** in the pop-up window to launch Windows Explorer, select your file and click **Open**. Enter a display name for the file into the Document Name field and, optionally, add a comment to the file. Select **Ok** when done.   
   The following file formats are allowed: .7z, .bin, .cab, .csb, .csv, .doc, .docx, .dotx, .gif, .ini, .iso, .jpeg, .jpg, .log, .msg, .nfo, .odp, .ods, .odt, .ost, .pcc, .pdf, .png, .potx, .ppt, .pptx, .pst, .rar, .rtf, .tar, .tar.gz, .txt, .vsd, .vsdx, .xls, .xlsx, .xltx, .xml and .zip.

   Uploaded license files are stored in the following folder, found on the computer hosting your web console: Program Files (x86)\Lansweeper\Website\DOCS\licenses
8. You can verify whether you're exceeding the number of licenses purchased by selecting **License report**.   
   ![managing-operating-system-licenses-6.jpg](/docs/.document360/assets/article_140/image_007.jpg)  
   The resulting page lists the number of OS installations detected in your network, the number of licenses you've purchased and the number of licenses that are missing. It also calculates the cost of filling in any missing licenses, based on the price per license you submitted. The license compliance report can be exported to an Excel file using the available button.
